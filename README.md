I'm a backend developer and consultant in technologies. I love to solve problems and automate your day to day tasks. I started my journey almost two decades ago, and now I own two companies, [The Kraken Web Company Inc.](https://github.com/the-kraken-web-company) & [Powered Software Inc.](https://github.com/PoweredSoft).
