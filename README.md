# Hi there, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

These days, Iâ€™m a **DevOps Engineer at [Gluwa Technology](https://gluwa.com)** â€” the folks behind **Creditcoin** & **Spacecoin** (and other things). I spend most of my time making sure things donâ€™t catch fire (and if they do, I automate the water hoses).

Before joining Gluwa, I was the president of both **The Kraken Web Company Inc.** and **Powered Software Inc.**. Both companies are now closed â€” not a tragic ending, just the next chapter in my career.

### What I Do
- Build and break things in the cloud
- Automate repetitive tasks so humans donâ€™t have to
- Design resilient systems that (hopefully) donâ€™t wake me up at 3 AM

### My Tech Journey
Iâ€™ve been at this for two decades now, starting as a backend developer and consultant. Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked with:

- **PHP**: Laravel, Symfony, CakePHP, WordPress, â€¦  
- **JavaScript / Node.js**: NestJS, Angular, React, Vanilla JS, NextJS, ExpressJS, â€¦  
- **.NET**: ASP.NET Core (APIs, MVC, Blazor), Entity Framework, â€¦  
- **Scripting, Automation & IaC**: Python, Bash, PowerShell, Bicep, Kustomize, Helm, Terraform, Ansible  
- **DevOps Tooling**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD, Azure Pipelines, Octopus Deploy, Vagrant  

Technology keeps changing, and Iâ€™ve learned to enjoy chasing the wave instead of fighting it.
